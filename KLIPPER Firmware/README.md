# Klipper Firmware
* Work in progress, will update as I go
* Need to follow [this](https://klipperscreen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Hardware/?h=ori#screen-rotation) to get the klipper screen rotation and touchscreen matrix setup correctly.
* Need to follow [this](https://github.com/bigtreetech/CB1/issues/44#issuecomment-1264733456) to get the gpio pins working if you get an parsing error.
